# Deep-Learning-Models
developing Deep learning models using python

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to generate descriptive captions for images. The project uses a deep learning model to automatically generate textual descriptions for a given image.

## Key Components:

## 1.Data Preparation:
The project starts by loading and preparing a dataset containing images and their corresponding captions. The captions are preprocessed by converting them to lowercase, removing special characters, and adding special tokens like "startseq" and "endseq" to indicate the beginning and end of captions.

## 2.Image Feature Extraction:
The code uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (DenseNet201) to extract features from the images. These image features are used as input to the caption generation model.

## 3.Caption Generation Model:  
The project uses a neural network model for caption generation. The model combines the image features and the textual information to generate captions. It consists of layers like LSTM, Dense, and Embedding for text processing.

## 4.Custom Data Generator:  
To efficiently handle large datasets, a custom data generator is implemented. It generates batches of data for training and validation. This approach helps manage memory usage and optimize training.

## 5.Training:  
The model is trained using the prepared data, and various callbacks like ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, and ReduceLROnPlateau are used to monitor and control the training process.

## 6.Evaluation and Testing:  
Currently evaluation code is not added but we can use BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr. Soon this part of code will be added to for further analysis.

## 7.Result Visualization:  
The code includes visualization of the training history (loss curves) and displays generated captions for a set of test images.

## 8.Overall Purpose: 
The project's main goal is to create a system that can automatically generate descriptive captions for a wide range of images. This can be useful in applications like image indexing, content retrieval, and accessibility for visually impaired individuals. The project leverages deep learning and natural language processing techniques to achieve this goal.
